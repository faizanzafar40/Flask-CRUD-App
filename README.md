# Basic Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Application in Flask

## Brief Description

A Flask implementation of a basic CRUD application

## Motivation
- My motivation for this practice project was to learn Flask and gain knowledge on database connectivity in Python.
- I got to understand the structure of a web application, demonstrate how to build one and work on the integration of a SQL database.
- With this initial step, I aim to quickly build web applications using Flask and SQLAlchemy in the future.
